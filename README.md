# Description
This project provides a comprehensive data analysis tool for medical trial datasets. It allows users to select and analyze data from two CSV files: Admin.csv and Labs.csv. The program performs various statistical analyses, including total units, maximum and minimum values, ranges, sums, averages, variance, standard deviation, and Z-scores. The results can be saved to a specified output file.
Features

•	Read and clean data from specified CSV files.

•	Calculate total units for medications and lab tests.

•	Identify maximum and minimum values for each category.

•	Calculate statistical metrics (mean, variance, standard deviation).

•	Compute Z-scores for normalized comparisons.

•	Save results to a text file for further use.

# Execution Instructions
To run this project in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1.	Set Up Your Environment:
2.	Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
3.	Upload the necessary CSV files (Admin.csv and Labs.csv) to your Colab environment.

# Import Required Libraries:

•	Ensure that you import the necessary libraries in your notebook:

- import csv
